    <h1>Hello Word</h1>
    <p>These enemies must be found. Because whether it's poverty or racism, the uninsured or the unemployed, war or peace, the challenges we face today are not simply technical problems in search of the perfect ten-point plan. We will all have to make concessions to achieve this. It should ensure opportunity not just for those with the most money and influence, but for every American who's willing to work. And that's what we have to restore. But if we see this conflict only from one side or the other, then we will be blind to the truth: the only resolution is for the aspirations of both sides to be met through two states, where Israelis and Palestinians each live in peace and security.p></p>

    <p>My faith teaches me that I can sit in church and pray all I want, but I won't be fulfilling God's will unless I go out and do the Lord's work. And finally they come to this elderly black man who's been sitting there quietly the entire time. In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time.</p>
        
    <p>Thank you.</p>
